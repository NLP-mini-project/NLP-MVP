# Project Description
Github is an online version control system that stores your code history. Repsositories are made to store different files that are written in various programming languages and named; usually based on what is inside the repository. The format for the repository titles are user_name/title. A github search query was made for COVID-19 and repository file titles were scraped and stored in a .json file. Natural Language Processing was applied to the README files in each repository and words were analyzed. A machine learning algoritm was applied to the information obtained from the natural language processing statifying on programming language in order to predict primary programming language of repository. The goal of the project is to be able to use README files to predict the primary programming language of each repository.
